warning: putting in large number of people can be slow, 
and combining them with long wait times can be VERY SLOW.
It might look like it's locking up, but it's just processing.
using 4000 people at 3 trips each took about 20 minutes for me

Bathroom Module:
	The concept that I used for the bathroom is fairly straight forward:
	There is a sign on the wall directly outside the bathroom, and only
	one person can look at the sign at a time. This is achieved through
	the use of locking mutexes around all access to the sign. The number
	of people in the bathroom is displayed on the sign, as is the sex of
	the last person to enter the bathroom. When a user attempts to enter
	the bathroom, they get the lock on the mutex, read the data on the 
	sign, and determine whether they can enter the bathroom. If they
	determine that they can enter the bathroom, they change the data on
	the sign to have their current gender as well as increase the number
	of occupants posted by one. If they determine that they cannot enter
	the bathroom, they simply stop looking at the sign, and get back into
	line. When a person comes out of the bathroom, they also get in the
	line (represented with the mutex) to look at the sign, except that 
	when they get to the sign, they do nothing but decrease the number
	of occupants by one. Since only one person can be looking at the sign
	at a time, there is no danger of two people modifying the sign's data
	at the same time.

Multi-Threaded Test Program:
	compile with `make` or `make all`
	run with ./bathroom X Y W Z
		where:
			X = number of occupants (men + women)
			Y = average number of times that each occupant uses the bathroom
			W = average time that the people go about doing other things
				between leaving the bathroom and getting back in queue
			Z = average amount of time that an occupant spends in the bathroom

		none of these numbers have particular units attached to them. for the sake
		of simplicity I would estimate (based on test values) that each unit is about
		4-5 seconds.

Test Cases:

	(5 people, each go ~6 times, 360 units apart, for about 36 units)
